Student Loan Recommendation System with Deep Learning

Overview

This project implements a deep learning model to predict loan outcomes and provides insights for building a recommendation system to suggest student loan options. The project uses a dataset containing student financial and academic information and focuses on training a neural network to classify loan outcomes based on this data. Additionally, a discussion on how to build a recommendation system for student loans is included.

Features

	•	Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and feature scaling to prepare the data for neural network training.
	•	Neural Network Model: A multi-layer deep learning model built using Keras to predict binary loan outcomes.
	•	Model Evaluation: Performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate the model on test data.
	•	Recommendation System Discussion: A brief overview of the type of data needed for building a recommendation system, filtering methods, and real-world challenges.

Usage

	1.	Clone the Repository:

git clone <repository-url>


	2.	Run the Jupyter Notebook: Upload the student_loans_with_deep_learning.ipynb notebook to Google Colab or run locally.
	3.	Train the Model: Preprocess the dataset and train the neural network using the provided code.
	4.	Evaluate the Model: After training, evaluate the model’s performance using the test dataset.
	5.	Recommendation System: Review the questions and answers related to building a recommendation system for student loans.
